                      <h2>Heat load calculator using the Transfer function method.</h2>
                        <p>The basic procedures for estimating the maximum design cooling load for a conditioned space were developed when all design calculations were performed manually. 
                        For this reason, extensive design analysis was not part of the primary load estimate. Today, with computers used for routine design calculations, the individual 
                        load elements may be evaluated more thoroughly and a comprehensive design analysis can be included with the results. The TFM method makes it possible to estimate t
                        he cooling load for a conditioned space on an hour-by-hour basis and to predict resultant conditions that can be expected in that space for various system types, 
                        control strategies, and operating schedules. So for 24-hour detail heat load calculation and energy analysis, 
                        we are developing software with our research that will be affordable and efficient.</p>

                    <h2>Radiant time series method for Indian condition</h2>
                       <p>"The radiant time series (RTS) method is a simplified method for performing design cooling load calculations that are derived from the heat balance (HB) method. 
                        It effectively replaces all other simplified (non-heat-balance) methods, such as the transfer function method (TFM), the cooling load temperature difference/cooling load factor (CLTD/CLF) method, 
                        and the total equivalent temperature difference/time averaging (TETD/TA) method. This method was developed to offer an approach that is rigorous, yet does not require iterative calculations, 
                        and that quantifies each componentâ€™s contribution to the total cooling load. In addition, it is desirable for the user to be able to inspect and compare the coefficients for different construction 
                        and zone types in a form showing their relative effect on the result. These characteristics of the RTS method make it easier to apply engineering judgment during cooling load calculation."
                        This excerpt captures the essence of the text, describing the significance of the radiant time series (RTS) method in cooling load calculations and its advantages in simplifying the process while providing insights into each component's contribution.</p>
