        <p class="sectionTag text-big">MacBook Description feature</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The MacBook is Apple's third laptop computer family, introduced in 2006. Prior laptops were the PowerBook and iBook. 
            The MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are the remaining models. The original MacBook was dropped in 2011 only to be resurrected
            thinner and lighter in 2015 and then discontinued in 2019.
            In 2015, new MacBooks featured Apple's Retina Display and higher resolutions, as well as the Force Touch trackpad that senses
            different pressure levels. By the end of 2016, all MacBooks used solid state drives (SSDs).
            he MacBook Pro was the first Mac laptop to use Intel CPUs, and the Pro line offers the fastest laptop processors and largest 
            screens (see MacBook Pro). In 2020, Apple replaced the Intel CPU with its own (see Apple M series).
            Launched in 2008, the Air is Apple's lightest laptop, and its touchpad added gesture-based multitouch like the iPhone. In 2023,
            a 15" Air debuted with the largest screen on an Air model. See Macintosh Portable and Mac computer.
            The MacBook is carved out of solid aluminum, thus giving it a distinctive look and a grayish-white hue. The MacBook Air in particular 
            has a thin and light design. There are two versions of the MacBook Air: the 11-inch, with an 11.6-inch screen; and the 13-inch, with a 
            13.3-inch screen. Apple splits the MacBook Pro into a 13-inch and a 15-inch, with the latter consisting of a 15.4-inch screen. Each computer
             has a full-size, backlit 78-key keyboard.
             The MacBook Air is Apple's least expensive notebook computer. While the 1st generation was released as a premium ultraportable 
             positioned above the 2006 – 2012 MacBook, lowered prices on subsequent iterations and the discontinuation of that MacBook has made it 
             serve as the entry-level Mac portable. The 2010 to 2017 base model came with a 13-inch screen and was Apple's thinnest notebook computer
             until the introduction of the MacBook in March 2015. This MacBook Air model features two USB Type-A 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 2 port, 
             as well as an SDXC card slot (only on the 13inch model). This model of MacBook Air did not have a Retina Display. A MacBook Air model with
             an 11-inch screen was available from October 2010 to October 2016. In 2017, the MacBook Air received a small refresh, with the processor
             speed increased to 1.8 GHz.
             
             On October 30, 2018, the MacBook Air underwent a major design change, dropping the USB Type-A ports, MagSafe, and the SD card slot in favor 
             of two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. It was updated with a Retina display and Intel Y-series Amber Lake i5 CPUs, as well as
             a Force Touch trackpad, a third-generation butterfly mechanism keyboard, and the Touch ID sensor found in the fourth-generation MacBook Pro, 
             but without the Touch Bar. The base price was also raised, although the base configuration of the 2017 model was retained until July 9, 2019, 
             when it was discontinued along with the Retina MacBook.[7] The base price of this model was also dropped to $1099 ($999 for students) on the same day.</p>

                <p class="sectionTag text-big">MacBook Working feature</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The MacBook family was initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines which preceded them, now making 
                    use of a unibody aluminum construction first introduced with the MacBook Air. This new construction also has a black plastic 
                    keyboard that was first used on the MacBook Air, which itself was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate MacBooks.
                    The now standardized keyboard brings congruity to the MacBook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body.
                    
                    The lids of the MacBook family are held closed by a magnet with no mechanical latch, a design element first introduced with the polycarbonate
                    MacBook. The Memory, drives, and batteries were accessible in the old MacBook lineup, though the newest compact lineup solders or glues all such
                    components in place. All of the current MacBooks feature backlit keyboards.
                    
                    The MacBook was discontinued from February 2012 until March 2015, when a new model featuring an ultraportable design and an all-metal enclosure
                    was introduced. It was again discontinued in July 2019 following a price reduction of the 3rd generation MacBook Air and discontinuation of the
                    2nd generation model.
                    As part of the Mac transition to Intel processors, Apple released a 13-inch laptop simply named "MacBook", as a successor to the PowerPC-based iBook
                    series of laptops. During its existence, it was the most affordable Mac, serving as an entry-level laptop that was less expensive than the rest of the
                     Mac laptop lineup (the MacBook Pro portable workstation, and later the MacBook Air ultra-portable). It was aimed at the consumer and education markets.
                    Successive revisions of the MacBook were sold to consumers between May 2006 and July 2011, by which time it been superseded by the MacBook Air which had 
                    a lower entry price.[2] Apple continued to sell the MacBook to educational institutions until February 2012.[3][4]
                    
                    During its existence, it was the best-selling Mac in Apple's history. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.
                    [5] Collectively, the MacBook brand was the "world's top-selling line of premium laptops."[6]
                    
                    There have been three separate designs of this MacBook. The original design used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after
                     the iBook G4. The second design, introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro, shared the latter's unibody aluminium casing, but lacked a 
                    FireWire port. A third design, introduced in late 2009, retained a similar unibody construction but changed back to white polycarbonate.</p>

                        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Operating Specifications
                            Apple bundles each MacBook with the OS X operating system. On each computer there's a dual-core processor from Intel’s Intel Core brand, 
                            with Turbo Boost technology for increased performance. Each MacBook Air gets a mid-range Intel Core i5, with a processing speed of 1.7 or 1.8 GHz. 
                            The 13-inch MacBook Pro has a 2.5- or 2.9-GHz chip, while the one on the 15-inch MacBook Pro is a more powerful but slower 2.3 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7. 
                            Peak installed memory on the MacBook Air is 8GB, with 1600MHz DDR3 architecture.
                            
                            Media and Communication
                            The built-in Intel HD Graphics 4000 handles basic video duties, with the 15-inch MacBook Pro getting a more advanced NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M. Audio specifications
                             include stereo speakers and a headphone port, with one omnidirectional microphone on the MacBook Air and two on the MacBook Pro. Wireless technology on the MacBook
                             consists of Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology for streaming audio and a Wi-Fi network adapter that enables Web browsing. Also included is a FaceTime Camera with a peak
                             resolution of 720 pixels. For storage, the MacBook Air has a 64- or 128-GB flash drive, while the MacBook Pro has 500 or 750GB of hard drive space. Added on the MacBook
                             Pro is an 8x Super Drive slot for playing CDs and DVDs.
                            
                            Interfaces
                            Apart from the aforementioned headphone jack, each MacBook has at least one port for the power adapter, two USB 3.0 ports and Apple/Intel’s Thunderbolt interface. 
                            A Secure Digital flash memory card slot is present on all models but the 11-inch MacBook Air. Exclusive to the MacBook Pro are an Ethernet port for wired internet connection,
                             FireWire 800 port for data transfer and an anti-theft device called Kensington Security Slot. The 15-inch MacBook Pro is the only model with audio line-in and audio line-out 
                            jacks for recording purposes.
                            
                            Display and Power
                            Each MacBook Pro has a high-resolution, LED-backlit glossy widescreen display. The maximum native resolution on the MacBook is 1,440 by 900 pixels. However, Apple provides a Retina 
                            Display option for the MacBook Pro that boosts resolution to 2,880 by 1,800 pixels. For power, the MacBook relies on a built-in lithium-polymer battery and a MagSafe 2 power adapter.
