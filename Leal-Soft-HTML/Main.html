        <p class="sectionTag text-big">HVAC Heatload Calculation</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems are integral to creating comfortable indoor environments in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.
             Properly sizing these systems is critical to their performance and efficiency. This is where HVAC heat load calculation comes into play. 
            <br> <br>
            <b>Purpose and Significance of Heat Load Calculation:</b>

                 HVAC heat load calculation serves a crucial role in the HVAC design process. The primary purpose is to determine the amount of heating or cooling capacity required to maintain desired indoor conditions,
                 including temperature and humidity, within a building. Accurate calculations are essential because they prevent common problems associated with HVAC systems.
                 <br> 
                
                <b>Data Collection:</b> 
                The first step in HVAC heat load calculation is data collection. This involves gathering detailed information about the building and its intended use. 
             
                The primary goal of HVAC heat load calculations is to determine the amount of heating or cooling capacity
                required to maintain desired indoor comfortconditions in a building.
               <br>  
               <b>Infiltration and Ventilation:</b>
               Assess the rate at which outdoor air infiltrates into the building and determine the need for mechanical ventilation. This helps maintain indoor air quality and impacts the load.
               Select HVAC equipment, such as furnaces, air conditioners, and heat pumps, based on the calculated load. Ensure that the chosen equipment matches the building's heating and cooling requirements.
